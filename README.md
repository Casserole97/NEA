I used git while writing the NEA for my computer science A-Level, and decided to upload it to Github after it was finished.

# What's an NEA?
A Non-Exam Assessment is an independent project that you need to complete under a time limit.
I chose to make a game centered around maze generation.

# About this project
It is a game written with Pygame.
The objective is to find the exit in randomly generated mazes of varying sizes and complexity while avoiding an enemy that's always moving towards you.
There is a timer and a high score, as well as two types of usable items which are spread out in the maze's dead ends.
Due to time constraints many planned features weren't included, but the project did well.
While working on this game, I had to study maze generation algorithms and learn the Pygame module from scratch. I encountered many intersting challenges and learned a lot about game development and writing big pieces of software.

# Notes
`MAZE_PYGAME_PROTOTYPE.py` and some files from `textures` are the only things needed to run the game, but I decided to keep the redundant files.
`MAZE_TEXT_PROTOTYPE.py` is the maze generation without the game, so to speak. It can create modifiable mazes and print them in the terminal.
There is a ~70 page (of which half is the game's code) write-up accompanying it in which I wrote about the analysis, design, development, and evaluation stages. It is in the files. Unfortunately it is the "unpolished" version, as I can't get my hands on the final version.
