I used git while writing the NEA for my computer science A-Level, and decided to upload it to Github after it was finished.

# What's an NEA?
A Non-Exam Assessment is a mainly independent project that you need to complete under a time limit.
I chose to make a game. I centered it around maze generation to make it a complex enough project.

# About this project
It is a game written with Pygame.
The objective is to find the exit in randomly generated mazes of varying sizes and complexity while avoiding an enemy that's always moving towards you.
There is a timer and a high score, as well as two types of usable items which are spread out in the maze's dead ends.
However, due to time constraints many planned features weren't included, and it is a bit half-baked, but it did well!

# Notes
`MAZE_PYGAME_PROTOTYPE.py` and some files from `textures` are the only things needed to run the game, I just decided to keep the redundant files.
`MAZE_TEXT_PROTOTYPE.py` is the maze generation without the game, so to speak. It can create modifiable mazes and print them in the terminal.
